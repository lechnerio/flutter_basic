# Flutter Basic
 a flutter basic package - blank app with some settings, I always tend to use.

## 📚 Introduction & Overview

I'm trying to put out an Android based Flutter-Project with all - *or at least most* - features I often use. If you want, feel free to use, adapat or improve this. 

## 🆕 Updates

- `10.03.2020` **Debugging**
    - removal of the debug badge
    - boundaries flag, set to false
- `12.03.2020` **Splashscreen**
    - Splashscreen for Android (icimage.png under `android/app/src/main/res/drawable`)
- `12.03.2020` **Sign in with Google**
    - requires the `android/app/google-services.json` file 


## 🚀 Future Plans: 

- **Firebase**
  - Firebase integration for writing, reading and deleting data
- **Analytics**
  - Google Analytics
     
## 🛠️ Installation

`$ flutter packages get`
